# Introduction of ML and Car Classification 

Explain Machine Learning :

Machine Learning is the subfield of computer science that "gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly program" A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performances measure P, if its performances on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. For example : traffic patterns at a busy intersection (Task T), we can run it through a ML algorithm with data about past traffic patterns (Experience E) and, if it has successful "Learned" it will then do better at predicting future traffic patterns (Performance measure P). 

Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Learning Algorithms(meaning that they were given labeled data to train on). The training data is continuously split into two more sub-nodes according to a certain parameter. The tree can be explained by two things, leaves and decision nodes. The decision nodes are where the data is split.

Decision Tree Pros:
1-Simple to understand and to interpret
2-List Requires little data preparation

Decision Tree Cons:
1-Prone to over-fitting
2-Decision trees can be unstable (a small variation in the data may result in a completely different tree being generated)
