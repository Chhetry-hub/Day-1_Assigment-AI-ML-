Explain Machine Learning 
Machine Learning is the subfield of computer science that "gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly program" A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performances measure P, if its performances on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. For example : traffic patterns at a busy intersection (Task T), we can run it through a ML algorithm with data about past traffic patterns (Experience E) and, if it has successful "Learned" it will then do better at predicting future traffic patterns (Performance measure P).
